## Quick Start

> The easiest way to get started with `@typestyled/tools` is to follow along 
> as we go through the examples.

### Installing @typestyled/tools

We recommend using [Yarn][1] or [npm][2] for managing front-end dependencies. 
If you are new to package managers, the [Yarn documentation][3] is a good place 
to start.

To install `@typestyled/tools` with Yarn, run:

```sh
yarn init
yarn add @typestyled/tools
```

To install @typestyled/tools with npm, run:

```sh
npm init
npm install --save @typestyled/tools
```

Both Yarn and npm download packages directly from the [npm registry][3].

#### Enable TypeScript and Typestyle

We recommend using `@typestyled` libraries with [TypeScript][4]. TypeScript is 
a strict syntatical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing 
to the JavaScript language, and [TypeStyle][5] is a type-safe CSS-in-JS 
framework that works nicely with Typestyled libraries.

### Hello Tools with TypeScript and TypeStyle

We recommend using a bundler like [webpack][6] or [Browserify][7], so you can 
write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize 
load time.

A small `@typestyled/tools` example looks like this:

```ts
